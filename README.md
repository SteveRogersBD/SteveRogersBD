## About Me

I am a Computer Science student at **Truman State University (GPA: 4.00)** building production-grade systems at the intersection of **backend engineering, distributed systems, and applied AI**.

My focus areas:
- Scalable backend architectures (Spring Boot, microservices)
- Event-driven systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Cloud-native deployment (Docker, AWS, CI/CD)
- AI-powered workflows integrated into real products

I prioritize **clean architecture, measurable impact, and systems that hold up under real users**.
